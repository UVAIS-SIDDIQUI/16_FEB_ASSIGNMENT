    "ANS = A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval and manipulation. Databases are used to store and manage large volumes of data in a way that allows for easy querying, updating, and analysis. They are a crucial part of modern software applications, ranging from simple to complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main categories of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases. Here's a differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Data:-\n",
    "SQL databases are known for their structured data storage. Data is organized into tables with predefined schemas, where each row represents a record and each column represents a specific attribute of that record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema:-\n",
    "SQL databases enforce a rigid schema, meaning that the structure of the database, including the data types of each column, must be defined before data can be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational Model:-\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model, where relationships between tables are established using keys (such as primary keys and foreign keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Compliance:-\n",
    "ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties are guaranteed in SQL databases, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language:-\n",
    "SQL databases use the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides a standardized way to perform operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:    MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Model:-\n",
    "NoSQL databases allow for flexible and dynamic data models. Data can be stored in various formats like key-value pairs, document-based structures, column-family stores, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less:-\n",
    "NoSQL databases are often schema-less or have a more relaxed schema model. This means that data can be added without a predefined schema, making it easier to adapt to changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational Model:-\n",
    "NoSQL databases do not adhere to the traditional relational model. Instead, they focus on distributed and scalable architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAP Theorem:-\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed with trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance (CAP theorem). Different NoSQL databases prioritize these trade-offs differently based on use case requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language:-\n",
    "NoSQL databases don't always use a standardized query language like SQL. Some have proprietary query languages, while others provide APIs for data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB (document-based), Cassandra (column-family), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph), Couchbase."

    "2 DROP:-\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views. Be cautious, as dropping objects deletes their data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Dropping a Table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This example deletes the \"Employees\" table and all its associated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 ALTER:-\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify existing database objects, such as adding or dropping columns, changing data types, or adding constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Adding a Column:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This example adds an \"Email\" column to the \"Employees\" table.\n",

    "Example - Truncating a Table:\n",

    "-->These DML statements are crucial for managing the data within a database. They allow you to insert new data, update existing data, and remove unwanted data, ensuring that the information stored in the database remains accurate and relevant.

Always perform thorough testing and backup procedures when working with DML statements, especially in production environments<--"

    "explanation and an example of the SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT:-\n",
    "The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve and apply conditions to filter the data.\n",

    "Example - Retrieving Data:\n",
    "Consider a hypothetical \"Products\" table with columns \"ProductID,\" \"ProductName,\" \"Category,\" and \"Price.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        SELECT ProductName, Price\n",

    "SELECT ProductName, Price specifies that you want to retrieve the \"ProductName\" and \"Price\" columns.\n",
    "FROM Products specifies that you are retrieving data from the \"Products\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE Category = 'Electronics' is a condition that filters the data, retrieving only the rows where the \"Category\" column is 'Electronics'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this query might be a list of product names and prices for products in the \"Electronics\" category.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also perform more complex operations with the SELECT statement, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Joins:-\n",
    "Combining data from multiple tables based on related columns.\n",
    "Aggregation: Calculating summary values like averages, counts, and sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting: Ordering the retrieved data based on specified columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping: Grouping data by specific columns for aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT statement is a powerful tool for retrieving and analyzing data from a database. It allows you to tailor your queries to your specific needs and retrieve the information you require for reporting, analysis, and decision-making."

    "Primary Key:-\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a special type of column in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each record (row) in that table. It ensures that every value in the primary key column is unique and not null. Primary keys play a critical role in maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between different tables within a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column must be unique across all records in the table. This uniqueness ensures that there are no duplicate entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-null: The primary key column cannot contain null values, ensuring that each record has a valid identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed: Primary key values are typically static and don't change over the lifespan of the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a \"Customers\" table with a \"CustomerID\" column as the primary key. Each customer has a unique identifier, and this identifier is used to distinguish one customer from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two different tables. It creates a relationship that allows data in one table to reference data in another table. The purpose of a foreign key is to maintain referential integrity, ensuring that relationships between tables remain consistent and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "References: A foreign key references the primary key of another table, creating a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintains Integrity: A foreign key helps maintain referential integrity by preventing actions that would create orphaned or inconsistent data, such as deleting a record in the referenced table while there are related records in the referencing table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows Joins: Foreign keys are used to perform JOIN operations, allowing you to retrieve related data from multiple tables based on their established relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have an \"Orders\" table with an \"OrderID\" column as the primary key, and a \"Customers\" table with a \"CustomerID\" column as its primary key. To establish a relationship between these tables, the \"Orders\" table might have a \"CustomerID\" column as a foreign key that references the \"CustomerID\" column in the \"Customers\" table. This allows you to associate each order with a specific customer."
